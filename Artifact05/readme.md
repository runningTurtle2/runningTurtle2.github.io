Demonstrate the use of Javascript events and objects to modify the DOM

Specifications:

In this assignment, you will create a slideshow (also known as a carousel or slider).  A slideshow is a script made from JavaScript that allows two or more images to show up as a slideshow.  You can find many examples on the web (see for example www.bellevuecollege.eduLinks to an external site.)

Your page will show an image with two buttons below:  Previous, Next
You can choose any FIVE images.  If you want, you can use the thumbnails of your previous assignments (i.e, Resume, Contact Us, Rhombus, Form Validation, Slideshow)
The image should be centered (use CSS for style)
Your page should pass HTML and CSS ValidatorIcons for validators must be present on the page.
Display the description of the image below it
Provide a way to show the images automatically.  You may need to use the setInterval Links to an external site.function
Your form should start with one picture.  When the user clicks next, it should show the next image, and so on. When you get to the last image and use clicks NEXT, it should show the first image.  Same if the user is in the first picture and it clicks Previous, the site should display the last image.

You must attach the events to the button using Javascript rather than using the event directly on the HTML file.
